# Http

This library was generated with [Angular CLI] to encapsulate all the http connection logic that angular applications handle

## Use in local

Run `ng build http` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Run `npm link` in the `dist/http` folder
Run `npm link @edutor/http` in the project to be used

Note: if we want that we change them to be activated automatically we must configure the option `--watch` like this` ng build http --watch` 

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build http`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/http` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test http` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
